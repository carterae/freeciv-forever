= Documentation of Freeciv -> Freeciv.net Patches =

The patches against Freeciv.org for Freeciv.net can be found here: 
[https://github.com/freecivnet/freeciv-web/tree/master/freeciv/patches]

The /freeciv directory is a fork of Freeciv.org trunk from 2009-10-18.
Patches should be applied in the order they were created.

Note that these patches are not intended to be committed directly to 
Freeciv.org SVN trunk, but represent some change which was required
to make the Freeciv.net web client work. This means that these patches
represent a change to Freeciv, which might have to be done in a better way. Most of
the patches are created because the Freeciv.net web client doesn't support a 
particular feature of Freeciv, and therefore a quick-fix solution has been patched in until this has been properly implemented in the Freeciv.net web client.
