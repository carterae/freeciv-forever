= Documentation of Freeciv -> Freeciv.net Patches =

The patches against Freeciv.org for Freeciv.net can be found here: 
[https://github.com/freecivnet/freeciv-web/tree/master/freeciv/patches]

The /freeciv directory is a fork of Freeciv.org trunk from 2009-10-18.
Patches should be applied in the order they were created.

Note that these patches are not intended to be committed directly to 
Freeciv.org SVN trunk, but represent some change which was required
to make the Freeciv.net web client work. This means that these patches
represent a change to Freeciv, which might have to be done in a better way.


= Details =
|| *Patch filename* || *Descrition* ||
||arctic-bugfix.diff||Makes arctic tiles get tundra graphics. This is a quick-fix because the web client don't support rendering the cell-based matching of arctic coastlines. This should be possible to implement, but not done yet.||
||goto_fix_1.diff||Bugfix on server-side goto in Freeciv web client. This patch resets the goto and AI control of the unit. This patch was created because it fixes a problem where units would suddenly get new orders assigned by the AI after a goto. ||
